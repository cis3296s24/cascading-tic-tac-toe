## About

### Rules
1. Games can be played until either a target score reached or a target time is elapsed.
2. A tie or a valid combination of three spaces in a row generates an additional 3x3 board that overlaps the previous board cascading down and to the right.
3. When a space has been used in a valid combination of three it may still be used in another combination of three if it does not create a combination of four or more.
