# Cascading Tic-Tac-Toe
This document details a continuous variant of tic-tac-toe where a tie between players or a valid combination of three spaces in a row generates an additional 3x3 board that overlaps the previous board cascading down and to the right. When a space has been used in a valid combination of three it may still be used in another combination of three if it does not create a combination of four or more. This variant is played with two players and each player can control where they place their respective ‘X’ or ‘O’ pieces on the board. Players can choose whether to set a target score (i.e.–first to five) or a timer where the highest score wins at the end and ties are broken with sudden death.
